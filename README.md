******************************** Welcome to AlexCycle ********************************************

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version : 2.6.5

* Rails version : 7.0.4.3

* Configuration : bundle

* Database creation : 1) rails db:create 2) rails db:seed

* How to run the test suite : bundle exec rspec

Simple as that, and you're good to go ðŸ™Œ
